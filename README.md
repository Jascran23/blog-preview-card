## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Google Fonts


### What I learned

During this project I reinforced and learned some important concepts.

- text alignment in the middle and on the left side.
```css
.container-avatar p{
    height: 100%;
    width: auto;
    font-weight: 900;
    color: hsl(0, 0%, 7%);
    margin-top: 0;
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue developing and achieve bigger projects with more clarity.


### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - For a better understanding of the flex display
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) -  A great resource for finding and implementing web fonts.
